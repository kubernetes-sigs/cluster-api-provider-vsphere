                              * Generated names must be valid Kubernetes names as they are used to create a VSphereVM object
                                and usually also as the name of the Node object.
                              * Names are automatically truncated at 63 characters. Please note that this can lead to name conflicts,
                                so we highly recommend to use a template which leads to a name shorter than 63 characters.

                          trySoft. The first mode, hard, is the equivalent of a physical
                          system's power cord being ripped from the wall. The soft mode
                          requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                          gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts
                          a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off
                          state after reaching the GuestSoftPowerOffTimeout, the VM is halted.

                          If omitted, the mode defaults to hard.

                              template defines the template to use for generating the name of the VSphereVM object.
                              If not defined, it will fall back to `{{ .machine.name }}`.
                              The templating has the following data available:
                              * `.machine.name`: The name of the Machine object.
                              The templating also has the following funcs available:
                              * `trimSuffix`: same as strings.TrimSuffix
                              * `trunc`: truncates a string, e.g. `trunc 2 "hello"` or `trunc -2 "hello"`
                              Notes:
                              * While the template offers some flexibility, we would like the name to link to the Machine name
                                to ensure better user experience when troubleshooting
                              * Generated names must be valid Kubernetes names as they are used to create a VSphereVM object
                                and usually also as the name of the Node object.
                              * Names are automatically truncated at 63 characters. Please note that this can lead to name conflicts,
                                so we highly recommend to use a template which leads to a name shorter than 63 characters.

                          powerOffMode describes the desired behavior when powering off a VM.

                          There are three, supported power off modes: hard, soft, and
                          trySoft. The first mode, hard, is the equivalent of a physical
                          system's power cord being ripped from the wall. The soft mode
                          requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                          gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts
                          a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off
                          state after reaching the GuestSoftPowerOffTimeoutSeconds, the VM is halted.

                          If omitted, the mode defaults to hard.
