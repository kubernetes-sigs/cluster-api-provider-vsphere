                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                  PowerOffMode describes the desired behavior when powering off a VM.

                  There are three, supported power off modes: hard, soft, and
                  trySoft. The first mode, hard, is the equivalent of a physical
                  system's power cord being ripped from the wall. The soft mode
                  requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                  gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts
                  a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off
                  state after reaching the GuestSoftPowerOffTimeout, the VM is halted.

                  If omitted, the mode defaults to hard.
                enum:
                - hard

                  system's power cord being ripped from the wall. The soft mode
                  requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                  gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts
                  a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off
                  state after reaching the GuestSoftPowerOffTimeoutSeconds, the VM is halted.
