          API A VirtualMachineImage represents a VirtualMachine image (e.g. VM template)
          that can be used as the base image for creating a VirtualMachine instance.  The
          VirtualMachineImage is a required field of the VirtualMachine spec.  Currently,
          VirtualMachineImages are immutable to end users.
