              VirtualMachinePublishRequestSpec defines the desired state of a
              VirtualMachinePublishRequest.

              All the fields in this spec are optional. This is especially useful when a
              DevOps persona wants to publish a VM without doing anything more than
              applying a VirtualMachinePublishRequest resource that has the same name
              as said VM in the same namespace as said VM.

                  resource.

                  see if there is a resource with the same name as this
                  VirtualMachinePublishRequest resource, an API version equal to

                  as the name of the published item. Additionally, when omitted the
                  controller attempts to identify the target location by matching a
