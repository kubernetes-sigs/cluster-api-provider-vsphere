                              VAppConfig may be used to bootstrap guests that rely on vApp properties
                              (how VMware surfaces OVF properties on guests) to transport data into the
                              guest.

                              The guest's networking stack may be configured using either vApp
                              properties or GOSC.

                              Many OVFs define one or more properties that are used by the guest to
                              bootstrap its networking stack. If the VirtualMachineImage defines one or
                              more properties like this, then they can be configured to use the network
                              data provided for this VM at runtime by setting these properties to Go
                              template strings.

                              It is also possible to use GOSC to bootstrap this VM's network stack by
                              configuring either the LinuxPrep or Sysprep bootstrap providers.

                              Please note the VAppConfig bootstrap provider in conjunction with the
                              LinuxPrep bootstrap provider is the equivalent of setting the v1alpha1
                              VM metadata transport to "OvfEnv".

                              This bootstrap provider may not be used in conjunction with the CloudInit
                              bootstrap provider.

                              Please note, this field is not required to encrypt the VM. If the
                              underlying platform has a default key provider, the VM may still be fully
                              or partially encrypted depending on the specified storage and VM classes.

                              If there is a default key provider and an encryption storage class is
                              selected, the files in the VM's home directory and non-PVC virtual disks
                              will be encrypted

                              If there is a default key provider and a VM Class with a virtual, trusted
                              platform module (vTPM) is selected, the files in the VM's home directory,
                              minus any virtual disks, will be encrypted.

                              If the underlying vSphere platform does not have a default key provider,
                              then this field is required when specifying an encryption storage class
                              and/or a VM Class with a vTPM.

                              If this field is set, spec.storageClass must use an encryption-enabled
                              storage class.

                              UseDefaultKeyProvider describes the desired behavior for when an explicit
                              EncryptionClass is not provided.

                              When an explicit EncryptionClass is not provided and this value is true:

                              - Deploying a VirtualMachine with an encryption storage policy or vTPM
                                will be encrypted using the default key provider.

                              - If a VirtualMachine is not encrypted, uses an encryption storage
                                policy or has a virtual, trusted platform module (vTPM), there is a
                                default key provider, the VM will be encrypted using the default key
                                provider.

                              - If a VirtualMachine is encrypted with a provider other than the default
                                key provider, the VM will be rekeyed using the default key provider.

                              When an explicit EncryptionClass is not provided and this value is false:

                              - Deploying a VirtualMachine with an encryption storage policy or vTPM
                                will fail.

                              - If a VirtualMachine is encrypted with a provider other than the default
                                key provider, the VM will be not be rekeyed.

                                Please note, this could result in a VirtualMachine that cannot be
                                powered on since it is encrypted using a provider or key that may have
                                been removed. Without the key, the VM cannot be decrypted and thus
                                cannot be powered on.

                              Defaults to true if omitted.

                          VMs that belong to a group do not drive their own placement, rather that

                          The logic that determines the guest ID is as follows:

                          If this field is set, then its value is used.
                          Otherwise, if the VM is deployed from an OVF template that defines a
                          guest ID, then that value is used.
                          The guest ID from VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM is ignored.

                          Please note that some guest ID values may require a minimal hardware
                          version, which can be set using the `spec.minHardwareVersion` field.
                          To see the mapping between virtual hardware versions and the product
                          versions that support a specific guest ID, please refer to

                          Please note that this field is immutable after the VM is powered on.
                          To change the guest ID after the VM is powered on, the VM must be powered
                          off and then powered on again with the updated guest ID spec.

                          This field is required when the VM has any CD-ROM devices attached.

                          Please note, unlike the field spec.imageName, the value of
                          spec.image.name MUST be a Kubernetes object name.

                          Please also note, when creating a new VirtualMachine, if this field and
                          spec.imageName are both non-empty, then they must refer to the same

                          deployed by VM Operator. An imported VirtualMachine resource references
                          an existing VM on the underlying platform that was not deployed from a

                          This field may be used to specify the name of a VirtualMachineImage
                          or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. The resolver first checks to see
                          if there is a VirtualMachineImage with the specified name in the
                          same namespace as the VM being deployed. If no such resource exists, the
                          resolver then checks to see if there is a ClusterVirtualMachineImage
                          resource with the specified name.

                          This field may also be used to specify the display name (vSphere name) of
                          a VirtualMachineImage or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. If the

                          spec.image field with the reference to the resolved VM image. If the
                          display name resolves to multiple or no VM images, then the mutation
                          webhook denies the request and returns an error.

                          This identifier is used by VirtualCenter to uniquely identify all

                          MinHardwareVersion describes the desired, minimum hardware version.

                          The logic that determines the hardware version is as follows:

                          1. If this field is set, then its value is used.
                          2. Otherwise, if the VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM contains a
                             non-empty hardware version, then it is used.
                          3. Finally, if the hardware version is still undetermined, the value is
                             set to the default hardware version for the Datacenter/Cluster/Host
                             where the VM is provisioned.

                          This field is never updated to reflect the derived hardware version.
                          Instead, VirtualMachineStatus.HardwareVersion surfaces
                          the observed hardware version.

                          Please note, setting this field's value to N ensures a VM's hardware
                          version is equal to or greater than N. For example, if a VM's observed
                          hardware version is 10 and this field's value is 13, then the VM will be
                          upgraded to hardware version 13. However, if the observed hardware
                          version is 17 and this field's value is 13, no change will occur.

                          Several features are hardware version dependent, for example:

                          * NVMe Controllers                >= 14
                          * Dynamic Direct Path I/O devices >= 17

                          Please refer to https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746 for a list of VM
                          hardware versions.

                          It is important to remember that a VM's hardware version may not be
                          downgraded and upgrading a VM deployed from an image based on an older
                          hardware version to a more recent one may result in unpredictable
                          behavior. In other words, please be careful when choosing to upgrade a
                          VM to a newer hardware version.

                              The elements are evaluated with the logical AND operator, meaning
                              all expressions must evaluate as true for the probe to succeed.

                              For example, a VM resource's probe definition could be specified as the
                              following:

                                      guestInfo:
                                      - key:   ready
                                        value: true

                              With the above configuration in place, the VM would not be considered
                              ready until the GuestInfo key "ready" was set to the value "true".

                              From within the guest operating system it is possible to set GuestInfo
                              key/value pairs using the program "vmware-rpctool," which is included
                              with VM Tools. For example, the following command will set the key
                              "guestinfo.ready" to the value "true":

                                      vmware-rpctool "info-set guestinfo.ready true"

                              Once executed, the VM's readiness probe will be signaled and the
                              VM resource will be marked as ready.

                          interaction inside of the guest. The Soft mode requires the VM's guest to
                          have VM Tools installed and asks the guest to restart the VM. Its
                          variant, TrySoft, first attempts a soft restart, and if that fails or
                          does not complete within five minutes, the VM is hard reset.

                          If omitted, the mode defaults to TrySoft.

                                          AutoLogonCount specifies the number of times the machine should
                                          automatically log on as Administrator.

                                          Generally it should be 1, but if your setup requires a number of reboots,
                                          you may want to increase it. This number may be determined by the list of
                                          commands executed by the GuiRunOnce command.

                                          Please note this field must be specified with a non-zero positive integer
                                          if AutoLogon is true.

                                          Password is the new administrator password for the machine.

                                          To specify that the password should be set to blank (that is, no
                                          password), set the password value to NULL. Because of encryption, "" is
                                          NOT a valid value.

                                          Please note if the password is set to blank and AutoLogon is true, the
                                          guest customization will fail.

                                          If the XML file is generated by the VirtualCenter Customization Wizard,
                                          then the password is encrypted. Otherwise, the client should set the
                                          plainText attribute to true, so that the customization process does not
                                          attempt to decrypt the string.

                              VAppConfig may be used to bootstrap guests that rely on vApp properties
                              (how VMware surfaces OVF properties on guests) to transport data into the
                              guest.

                              The guest's networking stack may be configured using either vApp
                              properties or GOSC.

                              Many OVFs define one or more properties that are used by the guest to
                              bootstrap its networking stack. If the VirtualMachineImage defines one or
                              more properties like this, then they can be configured to use the network
                              data provided for this VM at runtime by setting these properties to Go
                              template strings.

                              It is also possible to use GOSC to bootstrap this VM's network stack by
                              configuring either the LinuxPrep or Sysprep bootstrap providers.

                              Please note the VAppConfig bootstrap provider in conjunction with the
                              LinuxPrep bootstrap provider is the equivalent of setting the v1alpha1
                              VM metadata transport to "OvfEnv".

                                Please note, this could result in a VirtualMachine that cannot be

                          GuestID describes the desired guest operating system identifier for a VM.

                          The logic that determines the guest ID is as follows:

                          If this field is set, then its value is used.
                          Otherwise, if the VM is deployed from an OVF template that defines a
                          guest ID, then that value is used.
                          The guest ID from VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM is ignored.

                          For a complete list of supported values, please refer to
                          https://developer.broadcom.com/xapis/vsphere-web-services-api/latest/vim.vm.GuestOsDescriptor.GuestOsIdentifier.html.

                          Please note that some guest ID values may require a minimal hardware
                          version, which can be set using the `spec.minHardwareVersion` field.
                          To see the mapping between virtual hardware versions and the product
                          versions that support a specific guest ID, please refer to

                          Please note that this field is immutable after the VM is powered on.
                          To change the guest ID after the VM is powered on, the VM must be powered
                          off and then powered on again with the updated guest ID spec.

                          This field is required when the VM has any CD-ROM devices attached.

                          This field may be used to specify the name of a VirtualMachineImage
                          or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. The resolver first checks to see
                          if there is a VirtualMachineImage with the specified name in the
                          same namespace as the VM being deployed. If no such resource exists, the
                          resolver then checks to see if there is a ClusterVirtualMachineImage
                          resource with the specified name.

                          This field may also be used to specify the display name (vSphere name) of
                          a VirtualMachineImage or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. If the

                          spec.image field with the reference to the resolved VM image. If the
                          display name resolves to multiple or no VM images, then the mutation
                          webhook denies the request and returns an error.

                          MinHardwareVersion describes the desired, minimum hardware version.

                          The logic that determines the hardware version is as follows:

                          1. If this field is set, then its value is used.
                          2. Otherwise, if the VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM contains a
                             non-empty hardware version, then it is used.
                          3. Finally, if the hardware version is still undetermined, the value is
                             set to the default hardware version for the Datacenter/Cluster/Host
                             where the VM is provisioned.

                          This field is never updated to reflect the derived hardware version.
                          Instead, VirtualMachineStatus.HardwareVersion surfaces
                          the observed hardware version.

                          Please note, setting this field's value to N ensures a VM's hardware
                          version is equal to or greater than N. For example, if a VM's observed
                          hardware version is 10 and this field's value is 13, then the VM will be
                          upgraded to hardware version 13. However, if the observed hardware
                          version is 17 and this field's value is 13, no change will occur.

                          Several features are hardware version dependent, for example:

                          * NVMe Controllers                >= 14
                          * Dynamic Direct Path I/O devices >= 17

                          Please refer to https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746 for a list of VM
                          hardware versions.

                          It is important to remember that a VM's hardware version may not be
                          downgraded and upgrading a VM deployed from an image based on an older
                          hardware version to a more recent one may result in unpredictable
                          behavior. In other words, please be careful when choosing to upgrade a
                          VM to a newer hardware version.

                              all expressions must evaluate as true for the probe to succeed.

                              For example, a VM resource's probe definition could be specified as the
                              following:

                                      guestInfo:
                                      - key:   ready

                              With the above configuration in place, the VM would not be considered
                              ready until the GuestInfo key "ready" was set to the value "true".

                              From within the guest operating system it is possible to set GuestInfo
                              key/value pairs using the program "vmware-rpctool," which is included
                              with VM Tools. For example, the following command will set the key
                              "guestinfo.ready" to the value "true":

                                      vmware-rpctool "info-set guestinfo.ready true"

                              Once executed, the VM's readiness probe will be signaled and the
                              VM resource will be marked as ready.

                              VAppConfig may be used to bootstrap guests that rely on vApp properties
                              (how VMware surfaces OVF properties on guests) to transport data into the
                              guest.

                              The guest's networking stack may be configured using either vApp
                              properties or GOSC.

                              Many OVFs define one or more properties that are used by the guest to
                              bootstrap its networking stack. If the VirtualMachineImage defines one or
                              more properties like this, then they can be configured to use the network
                              data provided for this VM at runtime by setting these properties to Go
                              template strings.

                              It is also possible to use GOSC to bootstrap this VM's network stack by
                              configuring either the LinuxPrep or Sysprep bootstrap providers.

                              Please note the VAppConfig bootstrap provider in conjunction with the
                              LinuxPrep bootstrap provider is the equivalent of setting the v1alpha1
                              VM metadata transport to "OvfEnv".

                              This bootstrap provider may not be used in conjunction with the CloudInit

                              Please note, this field is not required to encrypt the VM. If the

                              or partially encrypted depending on the specified storage and VM classes.

                              If there is a default key provider and an encryption storage class is
                              selected, the files in the VM's home directory and non-PVC virtual disks

                              - If a VirtualMachine is not encrypted, uses an encryption storage
                                policy or has a virtual, trusted platform module (vTPM), there is a
                                default key provider, the VM will be encrypted using the default key
                                provider.

                              - If a VirtualMachine is encrypted with a provider other than the default
                                key provider, the VM will be rekeyed using the default key provider.

                              When an explicit EncryptionClass is not provided and this value is false:

                              - Deploying a VirtualMachine with an encryption storage policy or vTPM
                                will fail.

                              - If a VirtualMachine is encrypted with a provider other than the default
                                key provider, the VM will be not be rekeyed.

                                Please note, this could result in a VirtualMachine that cannot be
                                powered on since it is encrypted using a provider or key that may have
                                been removed. Without the key, the VM cannot be decrypted and thus
                                cannot be powered on.

                          VirtualMachineSnapshot resource in the same namespace.

                          Reverting a virtual machine to a snapshot rolls back the data
                          and the configuration of the virtual machine to that of the
                          specified snapshot. The VirtualMachineSpec of the
                          VirtualMachine resource is replaced from the one stored with
                          the snapshot.

                          If the virtual machine is currently powered off, but you revert to
                          a snapshot that was taken while the VM was powered on, then the
                          VM will be automatically powered on during the revert.
                          Additionally, the VirtualMachineSpec will be updated to match
                          the power state from the snapshot (i.e., powered on). This can
                          be overridden by specifying the PowerState to PoweredOff in the

                          If this field is set, then its value is used.
                          Otherwise, if the VM is deployed from an OVF template that defines a

                          Please note that some guest ID values may require a minimal hardware
                          version, which can be set using the `spec.minHardwareVersion` field.
                          To see the mapping between virtual hardware versions and the product
                          versions that support a specific guest ID, please refer to

                          Please note that this field is immutable after the VM is powered on.
                          To change the guest ID after the VM is powered on, the VM must be powered
                          off and then powered on again with the updated guest ID spec.

                          This field is required when the VM has any CD-ROM devices attached.

                              Each CD-ROM device requires a reference to an ISO-type
                              VirtualMachineImage or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource as backing.

                              Multiple CD-ROM devices using the same backing image, regardless of image
                              kinds (namespace or cluster scope), are not allowed.

                              CD-ROM devices can be added, updated, or removed when the VM is powered
                              off. When the VM is powered on, only the connection state of existing
                              CD-ROM devices can be changed.
                              CD-ROM devices are attached to the VM in the specified list-order.

                                    When true, the CD-ROM device is added and connected to the VM.
                                    If the device already exists, it is updated to a connected state.

                                    When explicitly set to false, the CD-ROM device is added but remains
                                    disconnected from the VM. If the CD-ROM device already exists, it is
                                    updated to a disconnected state.

                                    Note: Before disconnecting a CD-ROM, the device may need to be unmounted

                                    this CD-ROM should be attached.

                                    The bus number specifies a controller based on the value of the
                                    controllerType field:

                                    to the  first available IDE controller. If there is no IDE controller
                                    with an available slot, a new SATA controller will be added as long as
                                    there are currently three or fewer SATA controllers.

                                    If the specified controller has no available slots, the request will be
                                    denied.

                          VM.

                          This field may be used to specify the name of a VirtualMachineImage
                          or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. The resolver first checks to see
                          if there is a VirtualMachineImage with the specified name in the
                          same namespace as the VM being deployed. If no such resource exists, the
                          resolver then checks to see if there is a ClusterVirtualMachineImage
                          resource with the specified name.

                          This field may also be used to specify the display name (vSphere name) of
                          a VirtualMachineImage or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. If the
                          display name unambiguously resolves to a distinct VM image (among all
                          existing VirtualMachineImages in the VM's namespace and all existing
                          ClusterVirtualMachineImages), then a mutation webhook updates the
                          spec.image field with the reference to the resolved VM image. If the
                          display name resolves to multiple or no VM images, then the mutation
                          webhook denies the request and returns an error.

                          Please also note, when creating a new VirtualMachine, if this field and
                          spec.image are both non-empty, then they must refer to the same
                          resource or an error is returned.

                          it is not used within cloudInit.
                          This identifier is used by VirtualCenter to uniquely identify all
                          virtual machine instances, including those that may share the same BIOS UUID.

                          MinHardwareVersion describes the desired, minimum hardware version.

                          The logic that determines the hardware version is as follows:

                          1. If this field is set, then its value is used.
                          2. Otherwise, if the VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM contains a
                             non-empty hardware version, then it is used.
                          3. Finally, if the hardware version is still undetermined, the value is
                             set to the default hardware version for the Datacenter/Cluster/Host
                             where the VM is provisioned.

                          This field is never updated to reflect the derived hardware version.
                          Instead, VirtualMachineStatus.HardwareVersion surfaces
                          the observed hardware version.

                          Please note, setting this field's value to N ensures a VM's hardware
                          version is equal to or greater than N. For example, if a VM's observed
                          hardware version is 10 and this field's value is 13, then the VM will be
                          upgraded to hardware version 13. However, if the observed hardware
                          version is 17 and this field's value is 13, no change will occur.

                          Several features are hardware version dependent, for example:

                          * NVMe Controllers                >= 14
                          * Dynamic Direct Path I/O devices >= 17

                          Please refer to https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746 for a list of VM
                          hardware versions.

                          It is important to remember that a VM's hardware version may not be
                          downgraded and upgrading a VM deployed from an image based on an older
                          hardware version to a more recent one may result in unpredictable
                          behavior. In other words, please be careful when choosing to upgrade a
                          VM to a newer hardware version.

                                * The value may begin with a digit per RFC-1123.
                                * Underscores are not allowed.
                                * Dashes are permitted, but not at the start or end of the value.
                                * Symbol unicode points, such as emoji, are permitted, ex. ✓. However,

                          state after five minutes, the VM is halted.

                          If omitted, the mode defaults to TrySoft.

                              For example, a VM resource's probe definition could be specified as the
                              following:

                              With the above configuration in place, the VM would not be considered
                              ready until the GuestInfo key "ready" was set to the value "true".

                              From within the guest operating system it is possible to set GuestInfo
                              key/value pairs using the program "vmware-rpctool," which is included
                              with VM Tools. For example, the following command will set the key
                              "guestinfo.ready" to the value "true":

                                      vmware-rpctool "info-set guestinfo.ready true"

                              Once executed, the VM's readiness probe will be signaled and the
                              VM resource will be marked as ready.
