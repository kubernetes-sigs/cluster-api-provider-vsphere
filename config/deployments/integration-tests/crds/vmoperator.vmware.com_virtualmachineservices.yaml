          VirtualMachineService is the Schema for the virtualmachineservices API.
          A VirtualMachineService represents the desired specification and the observed status of a VirtualMachineService
          instance. A VirtualMachineService represents a network service, provided by one or more VirtualMachines, that is
          desired to be exposed to other workloads both internal and external to the cluster.

              VirtualMachineServiceSpec defines the desired state of VirtualMachineService. Each VirtualMachineService exposes
              a set of TargetPorts on a set of VirtualMachine instances as a network endpoint within or outside of the
              Kubernetes cluster. The VirtualMachineService is loosely coupled to the VirtualMachines that are backing it through
              the use of a Label Selector. In Kubernetes, a Label Selector enables matching of a resource using a set of
              key-value pairs, aka Labels. By using a Label Selector, the VirtualMachineService can be generically defined to apply
              to any VirtualMachine in the same namespace that has the appropriate set of labels.
