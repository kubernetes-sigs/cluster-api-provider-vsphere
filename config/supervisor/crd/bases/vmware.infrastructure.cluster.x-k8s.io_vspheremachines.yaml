                    description: |-
                      Template defines the template to use for generating the name of the VirtualMachine object.
                      If not defined, it will fall back to `{{ .machine.name }}`.
                      The templating has the following data available:
                      * `.machine.name`: The name of the Machine object.
                      The templating also has the following funcs available:
                      * `trimSuffix`: same as strings.TrimSuffix
                      * `trunc`: truncates a string, e.g. `trunc 2 "hello"` or `trunc -2 "hello"`
                      Notes:
                      * While the template offers some flexibility, we would like the name to link to the Machine name
                        to ensure better user experience when troubleshooting
                      * Generated names must be valid Kubernetes names as they are used to create a VirtualMachine object
                        and usually also as the name of the Node object.
                      * Names are automatically truncated at 63 characters. Please note that this can lead to name conflicts,
                        so we highly recommend to use a template which leads to a name shorter than 63 characters.

                  PowerOffMode describes the desired behavior when powering off a VM.

                  There are three, supported power off modes: hard, soft, and
                  trySoft. The first mode, hard, is the equivalent of a physical
                  system's power cord being ripped from the wall. The soft mode
                  requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                  gracefully shut down the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts
                  a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off
                  state after reaching 5 minutes timeout, the VM is halted.

                  If omitted, the mode defaults to hard.
