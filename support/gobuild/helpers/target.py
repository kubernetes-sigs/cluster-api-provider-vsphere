    Target Class

    The Target class encapsulates all the information required to
    build something.  Gobuild uses it to discover everythign it
    needs to know to build your product, including what code to
    sync, what commands to run to do the build, what bits should
    be copied to storage, etc.

    The steps to add a new target to gobuild go something like:

    1) Integ the gobuild target SDK into your product branch
       in the support/gobuild directory.

    2) Create a new python file called <your product>.py in the
       support/gobuild/targets directory.

    3) In <your product>.py, create a <Your product> class that
       overrides the methods in Target (or CompoundTarget)
       with the information specific to your product.

    4) Add your product to the TARGETS list in support/gobuild/__init__.py

    5) Profit!

    For more information, consult the gobuild sdk documentation.

        you decide to call your product in the TARGETS table in
        __init__.py (e.g. wgs, ws, vpx, server, p2v, etc).

        The long name should be the human readible name of your
        product.  It is also stored in the build database.

        Return a list of dictionaries describing which commands to run

        list as *small* and *rigid* as possible.  Best practices
        are that you should have 1 item in the list which is a call
        to some dispatching languge (e.g. make, scons, bash, etc)
        which will handle building everything you need for your
        scenario.  The idea is that this file sits on the interface
        between gobuild and your code and that there's value in having
        it change as seldomly as possible.  So if you need to tweak
        your product to build something differently, we'd rather you
        tweak a Makefile than the gobuild target file.

        Each dictionary should contain:

           'desc'    - Returns a short, human readible description of what
                       the task is doing.
           'root'    - The directory relative to the %(buildroot), from where
                       the command should be run.
           'log'     - The name of a logfile for the command.  Best practices
                       are for this to end in '.log'
           'command' - The command to run, including all command line
                       arguments.
           'env'     - (optional) A dictionary containing the environement
                       to use when running this command.  If you do not require
                       any particular environment, do not specify this key/
                       value pair.  It's recommended that you use
                       absolute paths (on linux) or %TCROOT% (on windows)
                       to point to tools in the toolchain rather than
                       modifying your environment to point to them, but
                       sometimes that is not an option.

        If you're using Make or Scons, there are helper functions
        to help you make your command (see below).

    def GetStorageInfo(self, hosttype):

        Return a list of dictionarys containing the directories
        which need to be copied to storage after the build is done.
        Only these directories will be preserved: the rest will
        be deleted!

        Each dictionary must contain:

            'type' : The type of directory at 'src'.  This must
                     be either 'source' or 'build'.  Source
                     directories are copied verbatim.  Build
                     directories are filtered by gobuild such that
                     intermediate information (e.g. .o's and .objs)
                     are removed before copying the directory to
                     storage.

            'src'  : The path relative to the %(buildroot) of what
                     you want copied.

            'keep' : An optional list of keep specifications that specify
                     files that you always want to store onto storage.

                     In order to save space when storing builds, gobuild
                     will normally filter out intermediate binary files
                     such as .o or .d when putting files to storage. However
                     sometimes this behavior isn't wanted. A keep spec
                     allows one to define a 'whitelist' of file(s) that will
                     always be stored.

                     A keep specification can be defined to keep a single
                     file, everything under a certain directory, or all
                     files with a certain extension in a directory.

                     'dir/subdir/myimportantfile.o'
                        -- stores dir/subdir/myimportantfile.o

                     'dir/subdir/*'
                        -- recursively stores everything under dir/subdir

                     'dir/subdir/*.o'
                        -- recursively stores all files ending with .o
                           under dir/subdir

        Here are some best practices to follow:

        1) Isolate your built bits into a single directory called
           'build'.  Do not generate build output side by side with
           your source!

        2) Be sure to isolate tools that you need to check out from
           your source and build directories and do *not* copy them
           to storage!  They don't need to be preserved.  Even better,
           use only tools that have been checked into the Build
           Toolchain.

        And some just for for multihost builds:

        3) Make sure that only one host copies the source to save time.

        4) When storing your build directory, add the hosttype to
           the beginning of the path to make sure windows and linux
           buildd don't collide (e.g. 'build' -> '%s/build' % hosttype )
