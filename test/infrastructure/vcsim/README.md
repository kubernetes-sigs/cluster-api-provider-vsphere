# vcsim controller

vcsim controller is a controller that provides one or more vcsim instances, as well as the VIP for control
plane endpoints.

## Architecture

vcsim controller is a regular Kubernetes controller designed to be run aside to CAPV when you are planning to use vcsim
as a target infrastructure instead of a real vCenter.

It is also worth to notice that vcsim controller leverages several components from Cluster API's in-memory
provider, and thus it is recommended to become familiar with this [document](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/test/infrastructure/inmemory/README.md)
before reading the following paragraphs.

### Preparing a test environment (using vcsim)

In order to understand the architecture of the vcsim controller, it is convenient to start looking only at 
components that are involved in setting up a test environment that will use vcsim as a target infrastructure.

A test environment for CAPV requires two main elements:

- A vCenter, or in this case a vcsim instance simulating a vCenter.
- A VIP for the control plane endpoint

In order to create a vcsim instance it is possible to use the `VCenterSimulator` resource, and the corresponding
VCenterSimulatorReconciler will take care of the provisioning process.

Note: The vcsim instance will run inside the Pod that hosts the vcsim controller, and be accessible trough a port that
will surface in the status of the `VCenterSimulator` resource.

Note: As of today, given a limitation in the vcsim library, only a single instance vcsim instance can be active at any
time.

In order to get a VIP for the control plane endpoint it is possible to use the `ControlPlaneEndpoint` resource, 
and the corresponding ControlPlaneEndpointReconciler will take care of the provisioning process.

Note: The code for CAPI's in memory provider is used to create VIPs; they are implemented as a listener on a port
in the range 20000-24000 on the vcsim controller Pod. The port will surface in the status of the `ControlPlaneEndpoint`
resource.

The vcsim controller also implement two additional CRDs:

- The `EnvVar` CRD, that can be used to generate variables to be used with cluster templates.
  Each `EnvVar` generates variables for a single workload cluster, using the VIP from a `ControlPlaneEndpoint` resource
  and targeting a vCenter that can be originated by a `VCenterSimulator`. 

- The `VMOperatorDependencies` CRD, that is explained in the [vm-operator](../vm-operator/README.md) documentation.

Please also note that the [vcsim.sh](scripts/vcsim.sh) script provide a simplified way for creating `VCenterSimulator`,
`ControlPlaneEndpoint`, a `EnvVar` referencing both, and finally copy all the variables to a .env file.
With the env file, it is finally possible to create a cluster.

```shell
# vcsim1 is the name of the vcsim instance to be created
# cluster1 is the name of the workload cluster to be created (and it used also as a name for the ControlPlaneEndpoint resource)
$ test/infrastructure/vcsim/scripts/vcsim.sh vcsim1 cluster1
created VCenterSimulator vcsim1
created ControlPlaneEndpoint cluster1
envvar.vcsim.infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster1 created
created EnvVar cluster1
done!
GOVC_URL=https://user:pass@127.0.0.1:36401/sdk

source vcsim.env

# After this command completes you have to run the printed source command
$ source vcsim.env

# Then you are ready to create a workload cluster
$ cat <your template> | envsubst | kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Using govc with vcsim

[govc](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/main/govc) is a vSphere CLI built on top of govmomi.

The [vcsim.sh](scripts/vcsim.sh) script described above, also sets the `GOVC_URL` and the `GOVC_INSECURE` env vars required to
use govc against the vcsim instance generated by applying the `VCenterSimulator` resource.

It is required to setup connectivity to the pod where this vcsim instance in running first.

From terminal window #1:

```shell
source vcsim.env
kubectl port-forward -n vcsim-system deployments/vcsim-controller-manager ${VSPHERE_SERVER##*:}
```

From terminal window 2:

```shell
source vcsim.env
govc ls
```

#### Accessing the workload cluster

Even if the workload cluster running on vcsim machines is fake, it could be interesting to use kubectl to 
query the fake API server.

Also in this case it is required to setup connectivity to the pod where the fake API server in running first;
this connection must be used when using kubectl.

From terminal window #1:

```shell
# from terminal window 1
source vcsim.env
kubectl port-forward -n vcsim-system deployments/vcsim-controller-manager $CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_PORT
```

From terminal window 2:

```shell
source vcsim.env

clusterctl get kubeconfig -n $NAMESPACE $CLUSTER_NAME > /tmp/kubeconfig
kubectl --kubeconfig=/tmp/kubeconfig --server=https://127.0.0.1:$CONTROL_PLANE_ENDPOINT_PORT get nodes
```

### Cluster provisioning with vcsim

In the previous paragraph we explained the process and the components to setup a test environment with a 
`VCenterSimulator` and a `ControlPlaneEndpoint`, and then create a cluster. 

In this paragraph we are going to describe the components of the vcsim controller that oversee the actual provisioning
of the cluster.

The picture below explains how this works in detail:

![Architecture](architecture-part2.drawio.svg)

- When the cluster API controllers (KCP, MD controllers) create a `VSphereMachine`, the CAPV controllers first create
  a `VSphereVM` resource. 
- When reconciling the `VSphereVM`, the CAPV controllers use the govmomi library to connect to vCenter (in this case to vcsim)
  to provision a VM.

Given that VMs provisioned by vcsim are fake, there won't be cloud-init running on the machine, and thus it is responsibility 
of the vmBootstrapReconciler component inside the vcsim controller to "mimic" the machine bootstrap process:
NOTE: This process is implemented using the code for CAPI's in memory provider.

- If the machine is a control plane machine, fake static pods are created for API server, etcd and other control plane
  components (controller manager and scheduler are omitted from the picture for sake of simplicity).
- API server fake pods are registered as "backend" for the cluster VIP, as well as etcd fake pods are registered as
  "members" of a fake etcd cluster.

Cluster VIP, fake API server pods and fake Etcd pods provide a minimal fake Kubernetes control plane, just capable of the
operations required to trick Cluster API in believing a real K8s cluster is there.

Finally, in order to complete the provisioning of the fake VM, it is necessary to assign an IP to it. This task is
performed by the vmIPReconciler component inside the vcsim controller.

Note: the documentation in this pager assumes you are using CAPV in govmomi mode, but it is also possible to use vcsim
to work with CAPV in supervisor mode. See [vm-operator](../vm-operator/README.md) for more details.

## Working with vcsim

### Tilt

vcsim can be used with Tilt for local development.

To use vcsim it is required to add it to the list of enabled providers in your `tilt-setting.yaml/json`; you can also
provide extra args or enable debugging for this provider e.g.

```yaml
...
provider_repos:
  - ../cluster-api-provider-vsphere
  - ../cluster-api-provider-vsphere/test/infrastructure/vcsim
enable_providers:
  - kubeadm-bootstrap
  - kubeadm-control-plane
  - vsphere
  - vcsim
extra_args:
  vcsim:
    - "--v=2"
    - "--logging-format=json"
debug:
  vcsim:
    continue: true
    port: 30040
...
```

Note: vcsim is not a Cluster API provider, however, for sake of convenience we are "disguising" it as a Cluster API
runtime extension, so it is possible to deploy it leveraging on the existing machinery in Tilt (as well as in E2E tests).

After starting tilt with `make tilt-up`, you can use the [vcsim.sh](scripts/vcsim.sh) script and the instruction above
to create a test cluster.

See [Developing Cluster API with Tilt](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/tilt) for more details.

### E2E tests

vsim can be used to run a subset of CAPV E2E tests that can be executed by setting `GINKGO_FOCUS="\[vcsim\]"`.

See [Running the end-to-end tests locally](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/developer/testing#running-the-end-to-end-tests-locally) for more details.

Note: The code for the E2E test setup will take care of creating the `VCenterSimulator`, the `ControlPlaneEndpoint`
and to grab required variables from the corresponding `EnvVar`.

### Clusterctl

Even if technically possible, we are not providing an official way to run vcsim controller using clusterctl,
and as of today there are no plans to do so.
