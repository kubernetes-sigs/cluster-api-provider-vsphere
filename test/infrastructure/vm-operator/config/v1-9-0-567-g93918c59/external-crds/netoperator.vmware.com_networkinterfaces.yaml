            NetworkInterface is the Schema for the networkinterfaces API.
            A NetworkInterface represents a user's request for network configuration to use to place a
            VM/Pod/Container's nic on a specified network.

                    PortAllocation is a request to allocate a port for this network interface on the backing network.

                    cases this field is ignored. Typically this is done implicitly by vCenter Server at the time
                    of attaching a network interface to a network and should be left unset. This is used primarily when
                    attachment of network interface to the network is done without vCenter Server's knowledge.
