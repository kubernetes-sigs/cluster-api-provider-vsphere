                  Capabilities describes the image's observed capabilities.


                  The capabilities are discerned when VM Operator reconciles an image.
                  If the source of an image is an OVF in Content Library, then the
                  capabilities are parsed from the OVF property
                  capabilities.image.vmoperator.vmware.com as a comma-separated list of
                  values. Well-known capabilities include:


                  * cloud-init
                  * nvidia-gpu
                  * sriov-net


                  Every capability is also added to the resource's labels as
                  VirtualMachineImageCapabilityLabel + Value. For example, if the
                  capability is "cloud-init" then the following label will be added to the
                  resource: capability.image.vmoperator.vmware.com/cloud-init.

                  The capabilities are discerned when VM Operator reconciles an image.
                  If the source of an image is an OVF in Content Library, then the
                  capabilities are parsed from the OVF property
                  capabilities.image.vmoperator.vmware.com as a comma-separated list of

              VirtualMachinePublishRequestSpec defines the desired state of a
              VirtualMachinePublishRequest.


              All the fields in this spec are optional. This is especially useful when a
              DevOps persona wants to publish a VM without doing anything more than
              applying a VirtualMachinePublishRequest resource that has the same name
              as said VM in the same namespace as said VM.
            properties:
              source:
                description: |-
                  Source is the source of the publication request, ex. a VirtualMachine
                  resource.


                  If this value is omitted then the publication controller checks to
                  see if there is a resource with the same name as this
                  VirtualMachinePublishRequest resource, an API version equal to
                  spec.source.apiVersion, and a kind equal to spec.source.kind. If such
                  a resource exists, then it is the source of the publication.

                  information and a ContentLibrary resource.


                  If this value is omitted, the controller uses spec.source.name + "-image"
                  as the name of the published item. Additionally, when omitted the
                  controller attempts to identify the target location by matching a
                  resource with an API version equal to spec.target.location.apiVersion, a

                  VM.


                  This field may be used to specify the name of a VirtualMachineImage
                  or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. The resolver first checks to see
                  if there is a VirtualMachineImage with the specified name. If no
                  such resource exists, the resolver then checks to see if there is a
                  ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource with the specified name in the same
                  Namespace as the VM being deployed.


                  This field may also be used to specify the display name (vSphere name) of
                  a VirtualMachineImage or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. If the
                  display name unambiguously resolves to a distinct VM image (among all
                  existing VirtualMachineImages in the VM's namespace and all existing
                  ClusterVirtualMachineImages), then a mutation webhook updates this field
                  with the VM image resource name. If the display name resolves to multiple
                  or no VM images, then the mutation webhook denies the request and outputs
                  an error message accordingly.

                  MinHardwareVersion specifies the desired minimum hardware version
                  for this VM.


                  Usually the VM's hardware version is derived from:
                  1. the VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM provided by the ClassName field
                  2. the datacenter/cluster/host default hardware version
                  Setting this field will ensure that the hardware version of the VM
                  is at least set to the specified value. To enforce this, it will override
                  the value from the VirtualMachineClass.


                  This field is never updated to reflect the derived hardware version.
                  Instead, VirtualMachineStatus.HardwareVersion surfaces
                  the observed hardware version.


                  Please note, setting this field's value to N ensures a VM's hardware
                  version is equal to or greater than N. For example, if a VM's observed
                  hardware version is 10 and this field's value is 13, then the VM will be
                  upgraded to hardware version 13. However, if the observed hardware
                  version is 17 and this field's value is 13, no change will occur.


                  Several features are hardware version dependent, for example:


                  * NVMe Controllers                >= 14
                  * Dynamic Direct Path I/O devices >= 17


                  Please refer to https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746 for a list of VM
                  hardware versions.


                  It is important to remember that a VM's hardware version may not be
                  downgraded and upgrading a VM deployed from an image based on an older
                  hardware version to a more recent one may result in unpredictable
                  behavior. In other words, please be careful when choosing to upgrade a
                  VM to a newer hardware version.

                  variant, trySoft, first attempts a soft restart, and if that fails or
                  does not complete within five minutes, the VM is hard reset.

                  disk without any interaction inside of the guest. The soft mode
                  requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                  gracefully suspend the VM. Its variant, trySoft, first attempts

                      VAppConfig may be used to bootstrap guests that rely on vApp properties
                      (how VMware surfaces OVF properties on guests) to transport data into the
                      guest.


                      The guest's networking stack may be configured using either vApp
                      properties or GOSC.


                      Many OVFs define one or more properties that are used by the guest to
                      bootstrap its networking stack. If the VirtualMachineImage defines one or
                      more properties like this, then they can be configured to use the network
                      data provided for this VM at runtime by setting these properties to Go
                      template strings.


                      It is also possible to use GOSC to bootstrap this VM's network stack by
                      configuring either the LinuxPrep or Sysprep bootstrap providers.


                      Please note the VAppConfig bootstrap provider in conjunction with the
                      LinuxPrep bootstrap provider is the equivalent of setting the v1alpha1
                      VM metadata transport to "OvfEnv".


                      This bootstrap provider may not be used in conjunction with the CloudInit
                      bootstrap provider.

                  This field may be used to specify the name of a VirtualMachineImage
                  or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. The resolver first checks to see
                  if there is a VirtualMachineImage with the specified name. If no
                  such resource exists, the resolver then checks to see if there is a
                  ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource with the specified name in the same
                  Namespace as the VM being deployed.


                  This field may also be used to specify the display name (vSphere name) of
                  a VirtualMachineImage or ClusterVirtualMachineImage resource. If the
                  display name unambiguously resolves to a distinct VM image (among all
                  existing VirtualMachineImages in the VM's namespace and all existing
                  ClusterVirtualMachineImages), then a mutation webhook updates this field
                  with the VM image resource name. If the display name resolves to multiple
                  or no VM images, then the mutation webhook denies the request and outputs
                  an error message accordingly.

              minHardwareVersion:
                description: |-
                  MinHardwareVersion describes the desired, minimum hardware version.


                  The logic that determines the hardware version is as follows:


                  1. If this field is set, then its value is used.
                  2. Otherwise, if the VirtualMachineClass used to deploy the VM contains a
                     non-empty hardware version, then it is used.
                  3. Finally, if the hardware version is still undetermined, the value is
                     set to the default hardware version for the Datacenter/Cluster/Host
                     where the VM is provisioned.


                  This field is never updated to reflect the derived hardware version.
                  Instead, VirtualMachineStatus.HardwareVersion surfaces
                  the observed hardware version.


                  Please note, setting this field's value to N ensures a VM's hardware
                  version is equal to or greater than N. For example, if a VM's observed
                  hardware version is 10 and this field's value is 13, then the VM will be
                  upgraded to hardware version 13. However, if the observed hardware
                  version is 17 and this field's value is 13, no change will occur.


                  Several features are hardware version dependent, for example:


                  * NVMe Controllers                >= 14
                  * Dynamic Direct Path I/O devices >= 17


                  Please refer to https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003746 for a list of VM
                  hardware versions.


                  It is important to remember that a VM's hardware version may not be
                  downgraded and upgrading a VM deployed from an image based on an older
                  hardware version to a more recent one may result in unpredictable
                  behavior. In other words, please be careful when choosing to upgrade a
                  VM to a newer hardware version.

                  requires the VM's guest to have VM Tools installed and attempts to
                  gracefully shutdown the VM. Its variant, TrySoft, first attempts
                  a graceful shutdown, and if that fails or the VM is not in a powered off
                  state after five minutes, the VM is halted.

                      The elements are evaluated with the logical AND operator, meaning
                      all expressions must evaluate as true for the probe to succeed.


                      For example, a VM resource's probe definition could be specified as the
                      following:


                              guestInfo:
                              - key:   ready
                                value: true


                      With the above configuration in place, the VM would not be considered
                      ready until the GuestInfo key "ready" was set to the value "true".


                      From within the guest operating system it is possible to set GuestInfo
                      key/value pairs using the program "vmware-rpctool," which is included
                      with VM Tools. For example, the following command will set the key
                      "guestinfo.ready" to the value "true":


                              vmware-rpctool "info-set guestinfo.ready true"


                      Once executed, the VM's readiness probe will be signaled and the
                      VM resource will be marked as ready.
